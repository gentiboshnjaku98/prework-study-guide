  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Hi,
This is a prework project prior of starting the ohia state university bootcamp from EDX.
Coding and web development are exciting ways to bring your ideas to life. They let you create cool websites and solve real problems. Every new project you tackle sharpens your skills and sparks your creativity. As you learn and grow in these fields, you’re not just building websites you’re shaping the future and making your mark on the tech world.
I had a lot of fun working on this project because I got to learn Git and GitHub and get some experience from working with it.

## Usage

in this project I added a fun fact about each topic and a little design on it so its more user friendly.
If you right click --> inspect --> Console you can see I added some javascript code you can interact with and shows all the topics I`ve learned so far.
and since the last line chooses a topic randomly maybe you can start learning to by choosing the first topic that shows up on the last line.
